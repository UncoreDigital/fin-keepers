      <p class="text-[#444] text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In the fast-paced world of business, staying competitive often necessitates upgrading systems to meet growing needs. This case study explores the journey of Company X as it transitioned from one Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor to another. The case study highlights the constraints, proposed solutions, and outcomes achieved.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#151515] mb-4">Background</h2>
      <p class="text-[#444] text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Company X, a mid-sized research company, had been relying on ERP 1 for its financial and accounting needs. However, as the Company's operations expanded, they encountered limitations in ERP 1's scalability, functionality, and integration capabilities. Recognizing the need for a more robust ERP system, Knowcraft Analytics as an offshore partner suggested ERP 2 to be implemented to meet the scale and defined expectations of the management. We assisted the management of Company X in selecting an appropriate vendor and implementing the ERP transition.
